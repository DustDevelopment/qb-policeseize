# qb-policeseize
Introducing my newest script that allows police to seize players' items. Use /seizeitems (id) (seize/return) to remove all items from a player's pocket. When a player is released from jail, their possessions are automatically returned upon completing their sentence. You can whitelists items such as food and water to prevent their removal.
