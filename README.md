# qb-policeseize
Introducing my newest script that allows police to seize players' items. Use /seizeitems (id) (seize/return) to remove all items from a player's pocket. When a player is released from jail, their possessions are automatically returned upon completing their sentence. You can whitelists items such as food and water to prevent their removal.


This script can be found at https://dust-development-fivem.tebex.io/package/6339410! I have had issues with people just stealing my code so i use the FiveM Asset Escrow System which means you have to get it through tebex. However it is FREE!
